# MyToken Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple e token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token is called "ONE" with the abbreviation "O". It includes functionalities to mint and burn tokens.

## Description

The MyToken contract allows users to mint new tokens and burn existing ones. 
The total supply of tokens is tracked, along with the balances of each address. This project serves as an example of basic token creation and management using Solidity.
